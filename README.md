# Do I Need a Visa?
A web-scraping project.

TODO (first iteration):
- [ ] Add 30 countries.
- [X] Deployed static site to Netlify
- [X] Scrape Wikipedia command ready
- [ ] Update Webpack to store each data/visa-requirements JSON file separately
- [ ] Use those files instead of GET endpoint, trigger-loaded
- [ ] Scraper should not completely rewrite files, just update changed entries
